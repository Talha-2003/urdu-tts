    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>tortoise-tts is a text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning model that focuses on improving the performance of Indian accents and supports Urdu text-to-speech. The project aims to address the limitations of existing TTS models when it comes to accurately replicating Indian accents and delivering high-quality Urdu speech synthesis.</p>
    <p>The model is built upon the powerful GPT-3.5 architecture, developed by OpenAI, which has been fine-tuned specifically for this project. By leveraging this robust architecture and training the model on a diverse dataset of Indian accents and Urdu speech, tortoise-tts achieves superior performance and provides a reliable solution for TTS tasks related to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Indian Accent Voice Cloning:</strong> tortoise-tts is designed to better capture and reproduce Indian accents, enabling accurate voice cloning for a variety of Indian English accents. It offers improved voice quality and natural-sounding speech synthesis for a more authentic experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Urdu Text-to-Speech:</strong> The model also includes support for Urdu text-to-speech, making it a versatile tool for generating spoken content in the Urdu language. Users can input Urdu text and obtain high-quality synthesized speech output.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> tortoise-tts can be easily integrated into existing applications or workflows. The model is accessible via a simple API, allowing developers to seamlessly incorporate its capabilities into their projects without extensive modification.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To utilize the tortoise-tts model, follow the instructions below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone the repository:</li>
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tortoise-tts.git</code></pre>
      <li>Install the necessary dependencies by running:</li>
